All non-functional requirements ** should be writes into documentation with criteria of acceptance and prioritizing **    
Diff between Functional and Non-Functional requirements

|Functional | Non-Functional |
| -- | --- |
|From customer|From devteam and members who have tech knowledge|
|what should be tested|how it needs to be tested|
|before application go live|when application is worked (see also [[Dynamic testing]])|
|known only as functional requirements|also may know as **Quality requirements** |
|implementation plan is define in system design document|implementation plan is define in system architecture|

Should be solve next questions:
* Test Metrics
* Test Tools
* Kye Dates and Deliverables

Non-Functional test tools:
* JMeter
* Loadster
* Loadrunner
* Loadstorm
* Neoload
* Forecast
* Load Complete
* Webserver stress tool
* WebLoad Professional
* Loadtracer
* vPerformer
