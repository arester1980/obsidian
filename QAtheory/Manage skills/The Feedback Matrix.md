The Feedback Matrix is a tool for overcoming your emotional responses to feedback, so that you can apply it and make positive changes to your performance or behavior. As shown in figure 1 below, it has four quadrants that refer to the different types of feedback you receive. These are:
* Positive/Expected
* Negative/Expected
* Positive/Unexpected
* Negative/Unexpected

Let's take a closer look at each quadrant.

- **Positive/Expected:** we often have a good idea of what we do well, because we tend to receive positive feedback about these things regularly. But instead of simply hearing this familiar praise and doing nothing with it, ask yourself:
    - How can I celebrate this aspect of myself?
    - How can I use this skill to increase my productivity or [job satisfaction](https://www.mindtools.com/a49jl03/creating-job-satisfaction)?
    - How can I use this skill to help others who are not as strong in this area?
    
- **Negative/Expected:** if we're honest with ourselves, we're often aware of some of the areas in our work that need improvement. If our boss asks for a meeting, chances are we know and expect what will be discussed. In fact, we're often more critical of ourselves than others are, but we just don't know how to improve without some help. To apply this expected feedback and make a positive change, ask yourself:
    - What actions have I already taken to address this concern?
    - How successful were those actions?
    - What else do I need to examine and/or change to achieve the results that I want?
    - If I don't make these changes, how will this impact my job or life?
    
- **Positive/Unexpected:** receiving [positive feedback](https://www.mindtools.com/a14bj7k/giving-praise) that we weren't expecting is like a surprise birthday present. It gives us a wonderful feeling when we learn something positive about ourselves that was totally unexpected. But after the initial joy, it's important to examine this feedback further by asking yourself:
    - Why was I surprised to hear this?
    - What previous experiences might have caused me to forget or dismiss this strength or ability?
    - How will I celebrate this newly discovered skill?
    - How can I use this skill to improve my life?
    
- **Negative/Unexpected:** this feedback is the most difficult to hear and understand. But it can also be the source of much self-discovery, if we're open to it. Unexpected feedback often comes from areas that we don't want to acknowledge, or aren't prepared to face, and it may cause us to become [defensive](https://www.mindtools.com/a80eurq/how-to-manage-defensive-people) or experience other [strong emotions](https://www.mindtools.com/amqbd0e/managing-your-emotions-at-work). However, when we learn to deal with it, we can take big steps forward on our journey of self-improvement. Some further questions to explore include:
    - What other information do I need to make sense of the feedback?
    - What support, training or coaching do I need to deal with the implications?
    - Can I use this feedback to discover more about myself? Our article, [The Johari Window](https://www.mindtools.com/au7v71d/the-johari-window), can help with this.
    - What plan can I put in place to make small, achievable changes in the short term?
    - How will improving this affect other areas of my job or life?
