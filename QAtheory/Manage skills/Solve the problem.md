| pin the problem         | Involves defining what the process is, the goals of stakeholders, and what previous efforts looked like. The result of pinning is a clear definition of what the problem really is. |
| identify all issues     | You identify all of the issues using a logic map to highlight the root causes of the problem(s) defined in step 1                                                                   |
| identify the best guess | Involves reviewing solutions to the issues identified in the logic map and selecting the solution that appears to be the highest priority                                           |
| analyze the paths       | Do an in-depth of analysis of your best guess on a solution and identify what will be gained by implementing this solution                                                          |
