##### Step 1 - What is our Goal?
Create list of key person for project with contacts:
- Project Manager
- Tester Lead
- Product Owner
- BA  
    Separate they into EPAM and External
##### Our product is:
- mobile application module
    - requirement
    - components
    - interface
- web application module
    - requirement
    - components
    - interface
- etc

all of them is our **Scope**  
**Out of scope** is module which works with our modules  
All from **Out of scope** should had info about person / team which take responsible for testing

We should reach a point of:
- What is Quality for customer?
- What are AC for customer?  
    ...and fix them into the Quality and AC Criteria part

##### Step 2 - Testing Action
We should get clear understand:
- tech side of project
    - what technology will use
    - what module will create
    - what CI/CD will create
    - what API will implement
    - etc.
What expectation from testing?  
What docs should be created by QA?  
What areas of responsibilities of QA from Stake Holder point of view?  
What environments exist?  
What branch strategy will be use?  
Automation is need or not?

The next step: all answers to these ^^ questions are laid down to timeline (Gannt's diagram) and link time gap for Communicate & Approve to each of actions.  
Info can transfer from Gannt to TEST SCHEDULE section

##### Step 3 - People / Roles / Team
Is need additional specialist for Perfomance or Security testing for example?

##### Step 4 - Risks
Gannt's Diagram + People are hint for found risk area.  
Risk are
- Product-Specific (tech and term and money etc.)
- Project-Specific (people)
Mitigation Plan - what we will do for decrease level of every risks  
Contingency Plan - wht we will do if Risk is come
