1. Split your organization into small, cross-functional, self-  
    organizing teams.
2. Split your work into a list of small, concrete deliverables. Sort the list by priority and estimate the relative effort of each item.
3. Split time into short fixed-length iterations (usually 1 â€“ 4 weeks), with potentially shippable code demonstrated after each iteration.
4. Optimize the release plan and update priorities in collaboration with the customer, based on insights gained by inspecting the release after each iteration.
5. Optimize the process by having a retrospective after each  
    iteration.
### So instead of a large group spending a long time building a big thing, we have a small team spending a short time building a small thing. But integrating regularly to see the whole.
