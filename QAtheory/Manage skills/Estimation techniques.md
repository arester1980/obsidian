1. Planning Pocker
2. The Bucket System
3. Big/Uncertain/Small
4. TFB / NFC / 1 (Sprint)  
    _This Agile estimation technique is similar to Big/Uncertain/Small but puts a specific “size” into the mix, namely 1 Sprint. The categories are “Too F-ing Big”, “No F-ing Clue” and “1” Sprint (or less)._
5. Dot Voting  
    _Each person gets a small number of “dots” and uses them as votes to indicate the size of an item; more dots means bigger._
6. T-Shirt Sizes
7. Affinity Mapping  
    _Items are grouped by similarity – where similarity is some dimension that needs to be estimated. This is usually a very physical activity and requires a relatively small number of items (20 to 50 is a pretty good range)._
8. Ordering Protocol  
    _Items are placed in a random order on a scale labeled simply “low” to “high”. Each person participating takes turns making a “move”. A move involves one of the following actions: change the position of an item by one spot lower or one spot higher, talking about an item, or passing. If everyone passes, the ordering is done._
9. Divide until Maximum Size or Less
