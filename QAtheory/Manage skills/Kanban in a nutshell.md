1. Visualize the workflow
    - Split the work into pieces, write each item on a card and  
        put on the wall.
    - Use named columns to illustrate where each item is in  
        the workflow.
2. Limit Work In Progress (WIP) – assign explicit limits to how  
    many items may be in progress at each workflow state
3. Measure the lead time (average time to complete one item,  
    sometimes called “cycle time”), optimize the process to make lead time as small and predictable as possible.

**The first WIP limit we used was 2n-1** (n= number of team members, -1 to encourage cooperation). Why? Simple, we had no better idea
