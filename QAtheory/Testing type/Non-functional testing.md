All non-functional requirements **should be writes into documentation with criteria of acceptance and prioritizing**  

| Functional                                              | Non-Functional                                                                                     |

| From customer                                           | From devteam and members who have tech knowledge                                                   |
| what should be tested                                   | how it needs to be tested                                                                          |
| before application go live                              | when application is worked (see also [Dynamic testing](joplin://f22bf58b4dc94cf1a163a2bcca12e5a1)) |
| known only as functional requirements                   | also may know as **Quality requirements**                                                          |
| implementation plan is define in system design document | implementation plan is define in system architecture                                               |
##### Should be solve next questions:

   * ##### Usability
   - ##### Reliability
    continuous work without failure
   * ##### Survivability
    recover itself after failure
* ##### [Security testing](joplin://936431fc3a13440d8faa779aa1f930d3)
* ##### Availability
    which user depend on the system
* ##### Reliability
- ##### Scalability
- ##### Efficiency
- ##### Reusability
 * ##### Portability
    can transfer to other environment
- ##### Flexibility
    work on different platform and environment
- ##### Interoperability
    checks a software system interface with other software systems

_there are about 100 kind of testing we can find in book_
