| **Focus On** | QA aims to prevent defects with a focus on the process used to make the product. It is a proactive quality process.           | QC aims to identify defects in the finished product. Quality control, therefore, is a reactive process. |
| **Goal**     | The goal of QA is to improve development and test processes so that defects do not arise when the product is being developed. | The goal of QC is to identify defects after a product is developed and before it's released.            |
