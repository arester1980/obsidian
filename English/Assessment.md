### Level based on:

1. **Discourse Management** - how well you can talk or write
    - Length - _In the Part 2 requires you to talk non-stop for 2 minutes; In the Part 1, it's good to give longer, well-explained answers_
    - Relevance - _your answer is related to the topic being discussed and that you're answering the question that was asked_
    - Hesitation - _you talk smoothly without long pauses or filler words like "um" or "er"_
    - Repetition - _repeat words or phrases and the whole ideas_
    - Self-correction - _similar to repetition: you basically say the same things twice which confuses or annoys your listener. Don’t get me wrong: if you realize you’ve just made a grammar mistake or used the wrong word, it’s ok to take a step back and correct yourself_
    - Coherence - _your ideas flow together well and make sense. A coherent speech is well-organized and easy to understand_
2. **Lexical Resource**
    - Range - _about the variety and complexity of your vocabulary_
    - Appropriacy - _vocabulary you use should be right for the context. It often has to do with the style (formal, informal, neutral)._
    - Accuracy - _mistakes in your vocabulary_
3. Grammatical Range and Accuracy
4. Interaction
    - ability to initiate the conversation and appropriately respond to the person
    - ability to maintain the interaction and develop the conversation in the direction that you need: exchanging updates, getting some information, negotiating a solution, etc.
5. Pronunciation
    - Intelligibility - _completely understood by your listeners, otherwise, how will you get your message across? And it’s not only about the impact of your national accent, a word or phrase can be ‘lost’ if you speak too quietly, or too fast, or just don’t put enough effort to articulate the words you say. So, as you see, it’s possible to be unintelligible even in your own language_
    - Individual sounds - _pronouncing separate words right_
    - Word stress - _put the stress on the wrong syllable, it distorts the word and makes it difficult for your listener to recognize it_
    - Sentence stress - _It’s what gives English its special rhythm. Remember, that in most cases we stress content words rather than structural words in a sentence. In this example the stressed content words are in the uppercase: “I’ve been WORKING for this COMPANY since OCTOBER.”_
    - Intonation - _English is quite ‘rich’ in terms of intonation, this is why English speakers often sound so emotional, especially in a conversation. Your voice goes up or down depending on the type of sentence, a place in a sentence, or a word that you want to highlight_
    - Connected speech - _n natural speech, words are not pronounced in isolation: when they come together they interact in different ways: Some sounds may change so that they match their neighbour sound: “It was a good c (goo/g/ /k/oncert)” // Some sounds may be lost: “you and me /you an’ me/”, “I can do it /I c’n do it/” // Some extra sounds may appear: “you are /you (w)are/”, “law and order /law (r)and order/” It all happens naturally, saving us the effort of articulation. Native speakers do it without even thinking, but you can learn and master the features of connected speech as well_
