## 1. Prepare for negotiation

> If you want to "Prepare the ground," "Get everyone on the same page" and "Get the ball rolling" for negotiations, you must send out an agenda with the goals of the negotiation meeting well in advance, ask for feedback on the agenda and update it if required.
> 
> - Collect all relevant information for the negotiation after elicitation with stakeholders and concerns from each party.
> - Get another BA to take notes not to miss any points and record the session – if necessary, with approval.
> - List the benefits of the best-case scenario and the disadvantages of the worst.
> - Highlight the AS-IS scenario and create the TO-BE scenario based on the best outcome for both parties.
> - Set clear objectives, comparing stakeholder concerns, then summarize where we are and try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

- **On the same page** // "_During the negotiations, the product manager and SME were on the same page_"
- **Get the ball rolling** // "_Ok, enough small talk, let's get the ball rolling_"

## 2. Open the negotiations

> If you "Play your cards right” and are "Above board" before "Getting down to the nitty gritty," you will be able to "Set the tone" and open the negotiations successfully.
> 
> - Ensure that your opening statement sets the tone for the rest of the meeting. Be open and sincere.
> - Facilitate the meeting professionally. Allow and encourage everyone to get involved and contribute.
> - This could involve presenting a RACI matrix with key responsibility areas for each stakeholder to focus on, if necessary.

- **Above board** // If business negotiations are described as above board, they are open, honest, transparent and legal - "_There is no secret agenda – our dealings are above board_"
- **Get down to the nitty gritty** // "_Thank you for your input, but let's get down to the nitty gritty_"
- **Set the tone** // "_The business analyst set the tone to start successful negotiations_"

## 3. Exchange information

> If you "Bide your time" and want to "Gain consensus" among the group, it is important to discuss the "Sticking points" to find the best solution.
> 
> - Gain agreement on the problem that exists and the possible solutions as a "win-win" for both parties.
> - Listen to concerns and difficulties and highlight them for discussion.
> - Gently challenge assumptions with facts.
> - Build rapport and trust throughout the conversation.
> - Highlight the common ground that everyone agrees on.

- **Bide your time** // If you bide your time, you wait for a good opportunity to do something - "_The BA is not hesitating; they are just biding their time, waiting for the group to understand each other's point of view before coming to an agreement_"

- **Sticking point** // A sticking point is a controversial issue that causes an interruption or blocks progress in discussions or negotiations - "_The choice of vendor was a sticking point in the negotiations_"

## 4. Bargain and Generate Options

> During your negotiations, some stakeholders involved may try to "Drive a hard bargain" and identify a "Bone of contention." Perhaps you can "Meet halfway" and "Leave the door open" to get a "Win-win" situation for all involved.
> 
> - Brainstorm ideas based the client’s pain points.
> - List some possible concessions and alternative options.
> - Break down the problem into smaller chunks to completely understand the problem or root cause of the issue.
> - Stay focused and align your thoughts on the best-case scenario and concerns from other parties.
> - Outline a prioritized list (MOSCOW: must, should, could, won’t haves) and gain consensus to define the prioritized scope.

## 5. Finalize Agreement and Conclude Negotiations

> To conclude the negotiations, you want to ensure that "No stone was left unturned" and everyone is "On the same page" by creating action items and "Keep them posted."
> 
> - Select a best-case scenario based on a mutually beneficial agreement.
> - Confirm the outcome and next steps.
> - Develop an action plan for moving forward.
> - Get the final agreement in writing and signed to close the negotiations, if required.
